    message: "I've tested all the pages and found that only the landing page is working correctly. The auth flow loads but fails when trying to sign up with a 500 Internal Server Error from the backend. The voice chat, dashboard, and settings pages don't load properly. The backend logs show issues with the N8N webhook for signup. I've also added the missing AuthContext.js file and updated the .env file with Supabase variables, but these didn't resolve the issues."

    message: "I've fixed the backend server.py file to handle the case when N8N webhooks are not available. I also fixed the DisplayNameStep.js to use the backend API instead of directly calling the N8N webhook. The signup process now works correctly and navigates to the display name step. However, the voice chat, dashboard, and settings pages still don't load properly. There seems to be an issue with the routing or component rendering after authentication."
