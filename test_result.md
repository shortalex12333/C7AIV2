Most endpoints are working correctly, but there are two issues that need to be fixed: 1) The update goal endpoint (/api/goals/{goal_id}) expects a 'goal_id' in the request body, which is redundant since it's already in the URL path. 2) The voice chat endpoint (/api/voice-chat) expects a 'user_id' in the request body, which is not being provided. These issues should be fixed to ensure all endpoints work correctly."
