    message: "I've added the Supabase environment variables to the frontend .env file and retested the application. The landing page and auth flow (including signup and display name collection) are working correctly. However, the voice chat, dashboard, and settings pages still don't load properly. The dashboard page is making API calls to endpoints like '/api/user-dashboard/test-user-123', but these are returning 404 errors. There seems to be an issue with the API endpoints or the backend implementation of these endpoints."
